# ovSAGE arduino night

## 2018-12-20

Here are a few of the sketches we talked about. Feel free to do whatever you want to do with them. I'll get around to adding a CC license at some point. These were cribbed from the official tutorials, other prople and some hackery on my part, as I'm not at all up to speed with this device.

I'll get around to adding a few more, as well as some links to other resources.
