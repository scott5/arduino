Here are a few of the sketches we talked about. Feel free to do whatever you
want to do with them. I'll get around to adding a CC license at some point.
These were cribbed from the official tutorials, other prople and some hackery
on my part, as I'm not at all up to speed with this device.

I'll get around to adding a few more, as well as some links to other resources.

The file BSG_Centurion-Eye_Scan_01.mp3 is a sound byte from the original BSG of
a Cylon scanner. If you search, you can find some exampes of how to use it with
a more sophisticated Larson scanner.


Blink_bes - Just a sketch to blink the onboard LED
Larson_bes - The Cylon scanner
barGraph_bes - A bar graph controlled with a pot
interrupt_intro - using the interrupt to trigger events

Software for the Kit on a shield (Basic Electronics Shield) can be found at the [Programming Electronics Academy](https://4c3q4z2euxqn29mk0e34ayce-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kit-on-a-Shield-Example-Code-20OCT16.zip)
